# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# merchant = Merchant.create!(name: "Rebekah's Circuits")
# bulk_discount_a = BulkDiscount.create!(merchant: merchant, percentage: 0.10, quantity: 10000)
# bulk_discount_b = BulkDiscount.create!(merchant: merchant, percentage: 0.20, quantity: 40000)
#
# other_merchant = Merchant.create!(name: "Not Rebekah's Circuits")
# bulk_discount_c = BulkDiscount.create!(merchant: other_merchant, percentage: 0.50, quantity: 60000)
